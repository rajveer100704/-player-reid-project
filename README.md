📌 Overview

     This project implements a Player Re-Identification (ReID) system that combines YOLOv8-based detection with embedding-based similarity matching to track and re-identify       players across video frames and camera feeds.
     It demonstrates how AI and computer vision can solve challenges in sports analytics, surveillance, and multi-camera tracking, while also serving as a base for further        AI experimentation.

🚀 Features

    🎯 YOLOv8-based player detection
    🔑 Feature embeddings for ReID
    🔄 Cross-camera identity matching
    📊 Single & multi-feed support

⚙️ Installation
           
    Clone the repository:
     git clone https://github.com/rajveer100704/-player-reid-project.git
     cd player-reid-project
     
    Set up environment:
